===========================
 Contributing to Placement
===========================

As an official OpenStack project, Placement follows the overarching processes
outlined in the `Project Team Guide`_ and `Developer's Guide`_. Contribution is
welcomed from any interested parties and takes many different forms.

To make sure everything gets the attention it deserves and work is not
duplicated there are some guidelines, stated here.

If in doubt, ask someone, either by sending a message to the
`openstack-discuss`_ mailing list with a ``[placement]`` subject tag, or by
visiting the ``#openstack-placement`` IRC channel on ``chat.freenode.net``.
